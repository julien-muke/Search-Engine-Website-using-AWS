# ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Project - Create a basic Search Engine website using AWS

## üìÑ Introduction

In this lab we will create a Gaming Search Engine (with a database of 5 games) from scratch in the AWS console using services/components like DynamoDB, Amplify, and API Gateway. Our Website will be hosted on a static HTML website. The HTML website will be powered by Amplify and will function from the API we create in API Gateway.


## üìê Architecture Design


As shown on the architecture diagram below: the users is going to log on to the AWS amplify and Amplify is going to hold our static website this is actually going to be the user interface and input a seach, once we search it's going to call on Amazon API Gateway, then it's going to call on AWS Lambda which is going to ask for permission in order to access Amazon DynamoDB which has the information that we're searching for in the AWS Amplify static website.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Create DynamoDB table

üëâ Create DynamoDB table

1. Go to the DynamoDB console
2. Click "Create Table"

3. Name the table "GamingSearchEngine" and name the partition key as "Name of Game". Keep everything else default

4. Click Create table at the bottom of the screen (may take a few minutes to create)



üëâ Populate DynamoDB table

Click the check box for the newly created database, click "Actions" dropdown menu, then click "Explore items"

2. Click "Create item" button
3. Fill out the Attribute value as shown in the screenshot below. To add the Category and ESRB Rating Attribute, click "Add new attribute" and select "String"

4. Repeat step for all 5 games shown below


| Name of Game | Category | ESRB Rating |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Grand Theft Auto V | Open World - Shooter | Mature - 17+ |
| Fortnite | Battle Royal Game | Teen - 13+ |
| God of War | Action-Adventure | Mature - 17+ |
| Call of Duty Warzone | First-Person Shooter | Mature - 17+ |
| Minecraft | Survival Game | Everyone - 10+ |



Note: You can duplicate an item to help expedite the process - shown in screenshot below

5. Once complete, the items in your table should look like what's shown below

## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 2 - Create Lambda IAM Role

Create the execution role that gives your function permission to access AWS resources.

To create an execution role

1. Open the roles page in the IAM console.
2. Choose Create role.
3. Create a role with the following properties.
        * Trusted entity ‚Äì Lambda.
        * Role name ‚Äì lambda-apigateway-dynamodb-role.
        * Permissions ‚Äì Custom policy with permission to DynamoDB and CloudWatch Logs. This custom policy has the permissions that the function needs to write data to DynamoDB and upload logs.

5. Replace the existing sample code with the following code snippet and click "Deploy"


üëâ Python CRUD Operation Code


```bash
    import boto3
    import json

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Create a DynamoDB client
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

    # Retrieve the partition key value from the event
    partition_key_value = event['Name of Game']

    # Get the DynamoDB table
    table = dynamodb.Table('GamingSearchEngine')

    # Call the get_item operation
    response = table.get_item(
        Key={
            'Name of Game': partition_key_value
        }
    )

    # Process the response
    if 'Item' in response:
        item = response['Item']
        # Do something with the item
        item_data = json.loads(json.dumps(item))  
        # Convert item to JSON-compatible format
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': item_data
        }
    else:
        return {
            'statusCode': 404,
            'body': 'Item not found'
        }

        
```

## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 4 - Test Lambda Function

Let's test our newly created function. Testing this function will make sure we will receive gaming information back when we search for the game.

Get Information for Minecraft Game

1. Click the arrow on the "Test" button and click "Configure test events"



![Screenshot 2024-01-01 at 13 37 19](https://github.com/julien-muke/Search-Engine-Website-using-AWS/assets/110755734/47223370-e946-41ad-a497-d7d008042c63)



2. Name the event "Test" then Paste the following JSON into the event. Afterwards, click "Save" to create.



```bash
    {
       "Name of Game" : "Minecraft"
    }
```

3. Click "Test", and it will execute the test event. You should see the output in the console

## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 5 - Create API and Deploy API

To create the API

1. Go to API Gateway console
2. Click "Create API"
3. Scroll down to REST API and click "Build"



![Screenshot 2024-01-01 at 13 44 16](https://github.com/julien-muke/Search-Engine-Website-using-AWS/assets/110755734/9965d864-9361-45fd-a729-6d6ec8186cb2)



4. Make sure to select "New API" and Give the API name as GamingSearchEngine, keep everything as is, click "Create API"



![Screenshot 2024-01-01 at 13 45 17](https://github.com/julien-muke/Search-Engine-Website-using-AWS/assets/110755734/13f8688b-67a7-4077-8687-6fa1d437329a)



5. Each API is collection of resources and methods that are integrated with backend HTTP endpoints, Lambda functions, or other AWS services. Typically, API resources are organized in a resource tree according to the application logic. At this time you only have the root resource, but let's add a resource next


Click on slash `/`, then click Create method"

6. Select "POST" in the dropdown and click the check button

7. Keep the integration type as Lambda Function. Make sure the Region is the same as your Lambda Function and DynamoDB (It should be because of the default settings).

8. In Lambda Function text bar type in `GamingSearchEngine` and select that lambda function we created in the previous step. Click "Create method.
